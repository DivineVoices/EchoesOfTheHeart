    Alors que Misute et moi sommes allongés sur l'herbe, profitant du soleil radieux du matin, un miaulement lointain de chat attire notre attention.
    Nous nous redressons tous les deux, cherchant la source du son.
    Misute « Hé, tu as entendu ça ? »
    Je regarde autour de moi, apercevant un petit chat noir aux yeux jaunes curieux, qui sort à moitié de derrière un buisson voisin.
    Prota « Oh, regarde là-bas. »
    Les yeux de Misute s'illuminent, toute la fatigue précédente disparaissant de son corps, son énergie est contagieuse.

    Misute « Viens ici minou, minou, minou. Allez, on ne te fera pas de mal. »
